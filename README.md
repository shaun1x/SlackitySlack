## Notes

If you're thinking about using this because it has some awesome features, do it. I didn't build it, but im sure as shit don't think it deserves not to exist. I used to like Slack because it ran cross platform in a browser, but pulling some lame BS of sending a lone open source developer a Cease and Desist for a fucking extension is a dick move. Its too late now anyway, does a fucking internet company not know how the internet works? Once this shit hit the web, its there...forever.

I don't really use Slack anyway, its usually forced upon me because the company I am working for at the time use it as a selling point ( serious ). Discord is better, Subreddits should used for OS projects and Jitsi is better for conference calls. There I said it.
